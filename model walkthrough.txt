INSTRUCTIONS\WALKTHROUGH - HOW TO RUN SEO COMPETITION
* Assuming you ran "create_g_data.py" and you have the competition data:
1. change the variable "current_prompt" to the name your run in config.py (integer recommended) 
2. run /lv_local/home/user/CharPDM/create_bot_followup_file.py to create an empty bot_followup_{cp}.csv 
	file
2.5 *** If BOT docs are needed . create BOT documents by running 
	/lv_local/home/user/content_modification_code-master/create_bot_features.py to create features (pay attention to ref doc \ location number)
	/lv_local/home/user/content_modification_code-master/choose_seo_texts.py (change pos argument!) to create the texts followup.
	Pay attention! change raw_ds_out into raw_ds_out_{pos}, move to saved_result_files and run first than second for all relevant positions
	move bot_followup_asrc.csv to /lv_local/home/user/CharPDM
3. change the prompt in /lv_local/home/user/CharPDM/competition_chatgpt.py if nescessary and run the 
	script to acheive the SEO texts
4. run /lv_local/home/user/CharPDM/text_validation.py to validate the texts validity and create 
	bot_followup_{cp}.trectext & working_set_{cp}.trectext
5. move trectext files to the folder /lv_local/home/user/content_modification_code-master/trecs
6. in the file /lv_local/home/user/content_modification_code-master/ranking_logic_example.py change 
	the argument current_times = ["{cp}"] and run it to merge the index and ranks the texts.
	If you are running the same "cp" make sure you delete both the relevant index and features from the results folder
7. run /lv_local/home/user/CharPDM/ranking_stats.py (cp already supposed to be the correct one in 
	config.py, validate it). in the end we get the new feature file
